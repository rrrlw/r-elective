## R elective for medical students

### Purpose

Elective teaching basic data analysis to medical students.
Education will focus on the R programming language to analyze clinical data.
The syllabus includes exploratory analysis, data visualization, and statistical inference.
Motivated students can also learn scientific writing and communication within this elective.
